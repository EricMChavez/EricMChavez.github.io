            <div id="aboutBody">I live in the beautiful city of Austin, Texas with my wife of three years and a couple of cats. I love the outdoors, making my own coffee, and finding a quiet spot to read and code. Learning is my true hobby, and after reaching a pinnacle in self-taught coding, I decided to take the leap and receive professional training in this field. I became full stack developer in Austin after completing a rigorous coding boot camp at Inventive Academy. While completing my vocational degree, I was hired as an intern with that very same company to learn the ins and outs of project management and best practices within the web developer community. Hard work is no stranger to me, and I’m known for my consistent work ethic and my attention to even the smallest detail. As my skill continues to develop through hands-on projects, I’ve learned that one of the greatest pleasures in life is taking pride in my work. I look forward to serving you.
